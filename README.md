# springboot-CodingPlatform-App

Develop a RESTful API service using Spring Boot to manage the Leaderboard for a Coding Platform while using MongoDB to persist the data.


## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 17]

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `CodingPlatformApplication.java`.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application will start running on port 8094.
